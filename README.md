Team: Mike Love, Adam Pugh, Enrique Otanez, Nebiat Adugna, Yusufu Kamara

Project Charter:
Group F will be bringing together 3 different data sources (2 from Kaggle and 1 from Github) that will bring together Greenhouse Gas information and Population.  We will be utilizing the population_total_long.csv file from Kaggle that has Country/Year/Total Population.   We will also be utilizing the greenhouse_gas_inventory_data.csv which has Country/Year/Value/Category.   We will bring in Regional Codes that will align to Country Name.  We will be taking these 3 data sources to have several tables that are linked by Country Name and blend these data sources together.
